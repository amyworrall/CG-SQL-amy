# : Code Coverage CG/SQL

Run this command in the `/sources` directory:

```
./cov.sh
```
This will run the test scripts with the coverage flag, which causes the coverage build.  If the tests pass a coverage report is created.

The same build options are available as `cov.sh` uses `test.sh` to do the heavy lifting.
