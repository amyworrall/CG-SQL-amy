# CG/SQL Playground

## CQL Playground
While we do not offer an interactive REPL environment, we have bootstrapped an environment to run simple CQL programs in the [`repl` folder of our repository](https://github.com/facebookincubator/CG-SQL/tree/main/sources/repl). You can run it by doing this from the CQL repository:

```bash
$ cd repl
$ ./go.sh
```

By default, you'll get this output:
```
../out/cql ready
CQL Mini App Thingy
Hello from CQL.
Edit as you please
```

[`go.sh`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/CG-SQL/tree/main/sources/repl/go.sh) runs the `go()` stored procedure defined in [`go.sql`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/CG-SQL/tree/main/sources/repl/go.sql). You can experiment with the CQL language by editing the `go.sql` file, as you please.

The contents of `go.sh` also offers a basic demonstration of how CQL should be typically used to transpile files into a C executable.

## Query Plan Playground
Within the same `repl` directory, we have a script that demonstrates [CQL's query plan generation feature](/cql-guide/ch15) with [go.sql](https://github.com/facebookincubator/CG-SQL/tree/main/sources/repl/go.sql).

Run this script in the `/repl` directory of the CQL repository:
```bash
$ cd repl
$ ./go_query_plan.sh
```

The script will generate the output of `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` of the SQL statements used in `go.sql`.

```json
["Query", "Stat", "Graph"],
[
  "INSERT INTO my_table(str) VALUES(\"Hello from CQL.\"), (\"Edit as you please.\")",
  [
    [],
    [{"value": "SCAN", "style": {"fontSize": 14, "color": "red", "fontWeight": "bold"}}, {"value": 1, "style": {"fontSize": 14, "color": "red", "fontWeight": "bold"}}],
    []
  ],
  "\n?\n|...SCAN 2 CONSTANT ROWS"
],
[
  "SELECT *\n  FROM my_table",
  [
    [],
    [{"value": "SCAN", "style": {"fontSize": 14, "color": "red", "fontWeight": "bold"}}, {"value": 1, "style": {"fontSize": 14, "color": "red", "fontWeight": "bold"}}],
    []
  ],
  "\n?\n|...SCAN TABLE my_table"
],
```

:::info
You might notice the above output has a lot of extraneous stuff, like what seems to be CSS styling in JSON format. This is something that will be addressed in the future. In the meantime, you can use [something like `jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to filter stuff out. For example:
```bash
$ ./go_query_plan.sh | jq '.[0][0][1:-1][] | {"query": .[0], "explain": .[2]}'
```
