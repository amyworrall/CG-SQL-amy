A brief note on why these files are here.

It would be easy enough to move these common files into the places that they are
used, e.g. into Makefile, test.sh and so forth.  In fact, all of this code began
directly in those files. The reason the code was pulled out was because the
original files (test.sh and so forth) had various assumptions about the build
environment.  In particular the build environment at Meta.  There was a bunch
of stuff there that is somewhere between useless and actively hostile to an OSS
release.

In order to avoid a fork, where the OSS had a totally different build, the
guts of the build, test, etc. were pulled out into these common files and
the outer files were configured to be as small as possible.  They mainly set
up variables and so forth.  This put the Meta-specific stuff in a few very
small files that hardly ever change and all the interesting logic could be
shared and part of the OSS package.  For instance, there is no knowledge of
the BUCK system in any of the OSS code.

Additionally, the Meta version of the tools included a few extra files and options.
The build was configured so that these would be included in the Meta build
but the OSS versions of the build files had no mention of them at all.  This
actually cleaned up a lot of the extension mechanisms so it had some fringe benefits.

This worked out well for several years, but the current situation is that the
Meta version of the tools does not push changes anymore and so this fork
is the only active one.  As a result the refactor into a common directory
just looks like an awkward thing and it provides no real value.  Still, in
the interest of allowing manual merges between the branches I'm disinclined
to change it.  But I thought it would be helpful to explain why it is the way
that it is.
